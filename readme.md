# Polymer Preferences Object
---
A [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org) element to update an object in localStorage.

This is just a simple example of how to create a custom Polymer component for a future tutorial of mine. When the tutorial is complete, I will clean it up and release it.

PS. Make sure to launch an simple web server before viewing the files, same origin policy rules don't play nice with the local filesystem.
